RAPTROWINGS - Languages File                             
----------------------------

You can customize the language file yourself if you want.<br />
You can change small entries or even add complete new languages.<br />
<br />
If you feel that you have made an important contribution with your change, contact Germardies on the Raptoreum Discord and after a review we will integrate your changes.<br />
<br />
In the following example we show how a new language can be created.<br />
<br /><br>

New Languages
-------------

1. Open the Languages.xml file in the Raptorwings/Languages/ folder with a text editor<br />
*Note: I personally use Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) for this*<br />
<br /><br />
2. First, the new language must be created in the Languages category. In this example, Spanish is added:<br />

<br/><br />
3. Now you can add Spanish in each individual entry:<br/>
