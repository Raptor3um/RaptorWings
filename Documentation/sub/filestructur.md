RAPTROWINGS - Filestructur                           
----------------------------
Even if you start Raptorwings from the unzipped folder, Raptorwings needs some other places to work:<br />
In the unpacked Raptorwings folder you will find the following folders:<br />
1. Third party for external applications, e.g. Putty<br />
2. Mining for the mining software, which is automatically downloaded<br />
3. Languages for the language file<br />
<br /><br />
The Raptorwings Folder in AppData
---------------------------------

Furthermore, the following folder is created when Raptorwings is started for the first time:<br />
PC:/Systempartition/AppData/Local/RaptorWings/<br />
All your data is stored in this directory.<br />
This is necessary so that all your data is still available after an update.<br />
All files are stored unencrypted so that you can see which data is being worked on.<br />
<br />
*Hints: All files in this folder are created in the international CSV format.*
The following files are in this folder:
1. main.dat with your Walletadresses from Profile 1-Default
2. sheet.dat with your Wingsheets
3. device.dat with the data of your external devices
4. pool.dat with the data where your devices perform the PoW
5. main(2,3...).dat with your Walletadresses vom Profile 2,3...
<br />
