RAPTROWINGS - Menu - MultiWING Mining                             
----------------------------
With MultiWING Mining you can start the mining process on external Linux devices.<br />
It is not yet available with all functions.<br />
You can only start the process and see the status in the overview.<br />
The status is read from the API's of the MiningPolls (not from the device itself).<br />
This area will be completely rebuilt again and made simpler, as well as provided with more functions.<br />
