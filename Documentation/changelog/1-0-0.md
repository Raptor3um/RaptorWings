RAPTROWINGS - Changelog v1.0.0 (26.02.2023)                            
-------------------------------------------

All listed changes and new features are always to be considered "Beta"/"Experimental" until the next release.<br />
We generally use the time between 2 releases as a functional test, which is performed by our community.<br />

Changes:
--------
1. Spanish language integration<br />
*Thanks to Team RTM Spain for the support*<br />

2. Small adjustment of the element, since by the additional Spanish language partly more place is needed.<br />

3. New Window/Tab: RTM Support<br />
*A small support page to download the latest corewallet, backup your wallet and for automatic bootstrap updates*<br />

4. New Mining Setting: Worker Thread Priority<br />
*Integrated as community wish for BenjixLeGaulois#7543*<br />

5. New Function: Query for saving the wallet list<br />
*If the wallet list has not yet been saved by the user and the user leaves the wallet menu or wants to close Raptorwings, *<br />
*a prompt now appears asking if the list should still be saved.*<br />

6. Change the Donation Adress to a Smartnode on SullyNodes</br />

7. Change Roadmap.md<br />

Bug Fixed:
----------
1. Bug fixed: The function for querying whether the SRBMiner multi is running as a Windows task has been changed. In the previous version the running process was not always detected, which made it possible to start the miner multiple times.<br />
2. Bug fixed: An old code fragment from the testnet caused the SRB miner to not use the full number of cores for a specific setting.<br />
<br />

Third Party Changes:
--------------------
Change SRBMiner-MULTI from Version 2.0.2 to 2.1.0
