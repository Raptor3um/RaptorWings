=============================================

Lightpaper
-----------
RAPTORWINGS is a fully open source free GUI software.
It serves as a Raptoreum dashboard and an easy tool for both mining and tracking RTM for the everyday user.
 
This software was written to provide the Raptoreum community with the following:
1. An overview of own wallet address(es) with balance and price display
2. A graphical interface for local mining
3. A graphical interface for mining connection to external devices
4. One of the easiest routes in blockchain for both new and experienced miners to get started with Raptoreum mining with both
   local and cloud based deployments

It is totally free to use without any fee.
Mining fee is set by the third party miner and the pool server.
If Raptorwings proves popular, we will continue to expand it.
